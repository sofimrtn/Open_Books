    <h2>Celsius 232 (Avilés, Asturias)</h2>
    <p>What to say about Celsius 232? It is the most acclaimed fantasy, horror and science fiction festival . And one
        day I have to go. Because yes, such an event is also free entry (there is only limit of capacity in certain
        activities and workshops) and free, but as it catches me quite far, I have not yet been able to escape.</p>

    <p>In Celsius 232 you will find talks by authors and book presentations, but also movies and games. I would have
        loved to go last year to meet authors like Patricia Esteban Erlés , Gabriella Campbell and Ana González Duque,
        of whom I have already spoken to you some time around, but it could not be. This year will be held from July 17
        to 20, and I'm sure that the guests will remain luxury . I still do not know if I will attend, but if it suits
        you, do not let it go! They say that the one who repeats.</p>

    <h2>Málaga 451: The Night of the Books (Málaga, Andalucía)</h2>
    <p>On the route of Spanish free literary festivals, we arrive in Andalusia, specifically in Malaga. Writers,
        booksellers, publishers and readers have already been publishing four editions in Málaga 451: La noche de los
        libros , a literary festival in which there is also room for theater and music. In 2018 it was celebrated on
        May 11, and in addition to talking about the most current literature, they paid tribute to Jorge Luis Borges
        through a large exhibition in which his widow, María Kodama, collaborated. There is nothing. If you are a
        lover of the novel, poetry, comics or essay, you can enjoy that magical night for free! Do you think about
        losing it?</p>

    <h2>Festival of Fantasy of Fuenlabrada (Fuenlabrada, Madrid)</h2>
    <p>If you have a predilection for the fantastic genre , you will love the Fuenlabrada Fantasy Festival. And as
        every year they focus on a theme (epic fantasy,  steampunk , the world of comics), they always want to return.
        In 2019 it will be celebrated on June 21, 22 and 23, and the theme chosen is the mythological Japan. Workshops,
        round tables, market troll, contest of illustration and stories and role-playing games are some of the many
        activities that are carried out in this literary festival free and free entry, which perfectly combines the
        didactic part with the playful.</p>

    <h2>Eñe Festival (Madrid)</h2>
    <p>The Eñe Festival is one of the most popular free literary festivals. In its last edition, held from October 15
        to 25, it exceeded fourteen thousand attendees, so imagine. In 2018, Malaga joined as host, and hosted this
        great literary meeting on October 26 and 27.</p>
    <p>Among the talks that took place last year, I highlight the one that focused on the proofreader as an irreplaceable
        piece in the editorial process , that of the national awards and the one that addressed the thorny issue of
        living in the story, that is, the money that really the writers win. And among the invited authors, I would have
        loved to see Samanta Schweblin , Rosa Montero, Elvira Lindo, Gioconda Belli and Almudena Grandes. And the entrance
        is free (until full capacity) to enjoy such a team! I have no choice but to aim the Eñe Festival on the list of
        free literary festivals that I have to attend at least once.</p>

    <h2>Golem Fest (Valencia, Valencian Community)</h2>
    <p>Golem Fest is a newborn free literary festival and I was lucky to attend its first edition. This festival focused
        on fantasy, horror and science fiction, but its programming could delight any reader and film buff (the seventh
        art also had a lot of weight). It was held on 7, 8 and 9 December 2018. Being a bridge, the influx of the public
        was affected, although there was enough participation to be its premiere.</p>
    <p>I admit that I spent a whole day there, among workshops, exhibitions, signatures and talks. I enjoyed the analysis
        of David Roas about the bad evolution of the fantastic monster in the cinema and television, the presentation of
        the wonderful Anthology Poshumanas and dystopian and the theater of terror of Vicente Marco . But my favorite
        moment was to meet Sophia Rhei in person , whom I interviewed in # UnAñoDeAutoras , because she signed me El
        bosque profundo and told Elia Barceló (another author of national literature) that she had read my blog and that
        she is very pimp. And what do you want me to tell you, one has a little heart, and hearing such things encourages
        you to keep working.</p>

    <h2>ENDEI: National Meeting of Independent Publishers (Castellón de la Plana, Comunidad Valenciana)</h2>
    <p>ENDEI was my first free literary festival. I attended its second edition, back in 2016, and I participated in its
        speed datings with editors to present my novel. Although I made a staging the sea of ​​pestle , I could not get any
        publisher decided to publish it, but I know of some authors and editors who have signed on that type of appointment.
        So if you cheer up, maybe you'll have more luck than me. Anyway, it helped me a lot to know how to talk about my
        novel and meet lovely people from the publishing world. In addition, I went to several round tables and talks,
        which gave rise to very intense debates.</p>
    <p>The 2019 edition, which will be the fifth edition, will be held from March 14 to 16 in Castellón . Admission is
        free and free, but to participate in speed datings , whether as a writer, proofreader , translator or illustrator,
        you must sign up. If you are interested, run !, because the registration closes next March 4 .</p>
