<h2>Harry Potter</h2>
<h5>by J.K. Rowling</h5>
<p>Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of
    a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts
    School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard
    who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all
    wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).</p>
<p> Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found
    immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as
    well as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature. As of February 2018,
    the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and
    have been translated into eighty languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling
    books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four
    hours of its release.</p>

<p>The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is the third highest-grossing
    film series of all time as of February 2018. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at
    $25 billion, making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

    A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes elements
    of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes
    many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death.[6] Other major themes in the
    series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.

    <h2>Lord of the Rings</h2>
    <h5>by J.R.R. Tolkien</h5>
    <p>The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. The
        story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger
        work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written,
        with over 150 million copies sold.</p>

    <p>The title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who had in an earlier age
        created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule
        all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the
        story ranges across Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters,
        not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck and Peregrin "Pippin" Took,
        but also the hobbits' chief allies and travelling companions: the Men, Aragorn, a Ranger of the North, and Boromir,
        a Captain of Gondor; Gimli, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas Greenleaf, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a wizard.</p>

    <p>The work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set, the other to be The Silmarillion,
        but this idea was dismissed by his publisher. For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was published in
        three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955.[3][5] The three volumes were titled
        The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Structurally, the novel is divided internally
        into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material included at the end. Some editions
        combine the entire work into a single volume. The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and
        translated into 38 languages.</p>
    <h2>A Song of Ice and Fire</h2>
    <h5>by George R.R. Martin</h5>
    <p>A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R.
        Martin. He began the first volume of the series, A Game of Thrones, in 1991, and it was published in 1996. Martin,
        who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy, has published five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and
        most recent volume of the series published in 2011, A Dance with Dragons, took Martin six years to write. He is
        currently writing the sixth novel, The Winds of Winter.</p>
    <p>A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The point of view of each
        chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to
        31 characters by the fifth novel. Three main stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families for control
        of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition
        of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.</p>
    <p>Martin's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon.
        A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion, as well as its realism.
        An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point
        of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire, questions
        concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence frequently arise.</p>
    <h2>The Chronicles of Narnia</h2>
    <h5>by C.S. Lewis</h5>
    <p>The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels by C. S. Lewis. It is considered a classic of children's
        literature and is the author's best-known work, having sold over 100 million copies in 47 languages. Written by
        Lewis, illustrated by Pauline Baynes, and originally published in London between 1950 and 1956, The Chronicles of
        Narnia has been adapted several times, complete or in part, for radio, television, the stage, and film.</p>
    <p>Set in the fictional realm of Narnia, a fantasy world of magic, mythical beasts, and talking animals, the series
        narrates the adventures of various children who play central roles in the unfolding history of that world. Except
        in The Horse and His Boy, the protagonists are all children from the real world, magically transported to Narnia,
        where they are called upon by the lion Aslan to protect Narnia from evil and restore the throne to its rightful
        line. The books span the entire history of Narnia, from its creation in The Magician's Nephew to its eventual
        destruction in The Last Battle.</p>
    <p>Inspiration for the series was taken from multiple sources; in addition to adapting numerous traditional Christian
        themes, Lewis freely borrowed characters and ideas from Greek and Roman mythology as well as from traditional
        British and Irish fairy tales. The books have profoundly influenced adult and children's fantasy literature since
        World War II. Lewis's exploration of themes not usually present in children's literature, such as religion, as
        well as the books' perceived treatment of issues including race and gender, has caused some controversy.</p>
    <h2>The Mortal Instruments</h2>
    <h5>by Cassandra Clare</h5>
    <p>The Mortal Instruments is a series of six young adult fantasy novels written by Cassandra Clare, the last of which
        was published on May 27, 2014. The Mortal Instruments is chronologically the third series of a proposed five in
        The Shadowhunter Chronicles but it was the first one published. It follows Clary Fray (who interacts with a group
        of Nephilim known as Shadowhunters) while also discovering her own heritage. The Shadowhunters protect the world
        of mundane people, who are also called mundanes or "mundies", from dark forces beyond their world.</p>

    <p>The book series has become one of the most popular within the young adult genre of paranormal romance/urban fantasy,
        but Clare did not originally intend to write the series for teens. When she began writing City of Bones, she did
        not view it as a young adult work, but first and foremost as a fantasy novel, where the main characters just
        happened to be teenagers. When she was approached by a publisher interested in aging up her characters, she ultimately
        decided that she "wanted to tell a story about characters at that crucial life stage just between adolescence
        and adulthood, where your choices determine the kind of person you're going to be rather than reflecting who you
        already are." The decision to launch her novels as Young Adult books has propelled Clare to the top of the
        Bestsellers list and has established The Shadowhunter Chronicles as some of the most popular works read by a
        largely young adult audience.</p>
    <h2>Divergent</h2>
    <h5>by Veronica Roth</h5>
    <p>The Divergent trilogy is a series of young adult science fiction adventure novels by American novelist Veronica
        Roth set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian Chicago. The trilogy consists of Divergent (2011), Insurgent (2012) and
        Allegiant (2013). A related book, Four (2014), presents a series of short stories told from the perspective of
        one of the trilogy's characters. A later short story, We Can Be Mended (2018), serves as an epilogue five years
        after the events of the trilogy from the perspective of the same character as the previous add on.</p>

    <p>The society of the trilogy defines its citizens by their social and personality-related affiliation with five
         different factions, which removes the threat of anyone exercising independent will and threatening the population's
         safety. Beatrice Prior, who later changes her name to Tris, an Abnegation-born and Dauntless transfer, must figure
         out her life as a Divergent, while concealing her true nature, and living with the danger of being killed if it
         is discovered by the Erudite and Dauntless leaders.</p>
    <h2>Percy Jackson & the Olympians</h2>
    <h5>Rick Riordan</h5>
    <p>Percy Jackson & the Olympians, often shortened to Percy Jackson, is a pentalogy of fantasy adventure novels written
        by American author Rick Riordan (also called Uncle Rick by his fans and readers), and the first book series in the
        Camp Half-Blood Chronicles. Five supplementary books, along with three graphic novels, have also been released.
        More than 45 million copies of the books have been sold in more than 35 countries.</p>

    <p>As of October 28, 2011, the series has been on The New York Times Best Seller list for children's book series for 245 weeks.
        The first book was adapted into a film titled Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief in 2010, which was
        commercially successful, but received mixed reviews (because of the change in the sequence of various scenes and events)
        from fans around the world. An adaptation of the second book, titled Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, was released in 2013.</p>
    <h2>Twilight</h2>
    <h5>by Stephenie Meyer</h5>
    <p>Twilight is a series of four vampire-themed fantasy romance novels by American author Stephenie Meyer. Released
        annually from 2005 through 2008, the four books chart the later teen years of Isabella "Bella" Swan, a girl who
        moves to Forks, Washington, and falls in love with a 104-year-old vampire named Edward Cullen. The series is told
        primarily from Bella's point of view, with the epilogue of Eclipse and Part II of Breaking Dawn being told from
        the viewpoint of character Jacob Black, a werewolf. The unpublished Midnight Sun is a retelling of the first book,
        Twilight, from Edward Cullen's point of view. The novella The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner, which tells the
        story of a newborn vampire who appeared in Eclipse, was published on June 5, 2010, as a hardcover book and on
        June 7 as a free online ebook. The Twilight Saga: The Official Illustrated Guide, a definitive encyclopedic reference
        with nearly 100 full color illustrations, was released in bookstores on April 12, 2011.</p>

    <p>Since the release of the first novel, Twilight, in 2005, the books have gained immense popularity and commercial
        success around the world. The series is most popular among young adults; the four books have won multiple awards,
        most notably the 2008 British Book Award for "Children's Book of the Year" for Breaking Dawn, while the series as
        a whole won the 2009 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Book.</p>

    <p>In November 2011, the series had sold over 120 million copies worldwide with translations into at least 38 different
        languages around the globe. The four Twilight books have consecutively set records as the biggest selling novels
        of 2008 on the USA Today Best-Selling Books list and have spent over 235 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller
        list for Children's Series Books. </p>
    <h2>Fifty Shades of Grey</h2>
    <h5>by E.L. James</h5>
    <p>Fifty Shades of Grey is a 2011 erotic romance novel by British author E. L. James. It became the first instalment
        in the Fifty Shades novel series that traces the deepening relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia
        Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey. It is notable for its explicitly erotic scenes featuring
        elements of sexual practices involving BDSM (bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, and sadism/masochism).
        Originally self-published as an ebook and print-on-demand, the publishing rights to the novel were acquired by
        Vintage Books in March 2012.</p>
    <p>Fifty Shades of Grey has topped best-seller lists around the world, selling over 125 million copies worldwide by
        June 2015. It has been translated into 52 languages, and set a record in the United Kingdom as the fastest-selling
        paperback of all time. Critical reception of the book, however, has tended towards the negative, with the
        quality of its prose generally seen as poor. Universal Pictures and Focus Features produced a film adaptation,
        which was released on 13 February 2015, and also received unfavourable reviews even though it was a box office success.</p>
    <p>The second and third volumes of the original Fifty Shades trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed,
        were published in 2012. Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian, a version of Fifty Shades of Grey being
